Rummaging through my brain looking for a word or phrase that could convey what it might mean for an introvert to build the skills to communicate, share and build in public, I learned that 'vert' in Latin means 'to turn'. Communication especially of the verbal form is mastered by orators. Putting these together, oratorvert seemed appropriate to capture my efforts to build the skills to turn into a communicator of ideas.
